# Urgelle's website
Everything that makes my website

A simple personal HTML and CSS
website, done by someone who
doesn't know HTML nor CSS.

Uploaded to Github to help me 
notice if there's any spaghetti code.
(All of it is probably considered
spaghetti code to be honest.)
And to make it easily searchable.
